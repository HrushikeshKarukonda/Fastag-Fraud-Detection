# Fastag-Fraud-Detection

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on analyzing Indian highway toll collections to understand revenue trends, vehicle traffic, and plaza-wise performance. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help authorities and stakeholders optimize toll management, identify low-performing plazas, and improve decision-making.

The dataset was prepared from FASTag toll collection records and visualized using Power BI, Excel, and AI-assisted data processing. The dashboard highlights 10+ KPIs related to toll revenue, vehicle count, and state-wise distribution.

## üéØ Objectives

To analyze total toll revenue and vehicle traffic trends.

To identify top-performing toll plazas and low-revenue locations.

To compare toll collections across states.

To evaluate the average toll per vehicle for performance benchmarking.

To provide an interactive dashboard for real-time insights
